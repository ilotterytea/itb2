# Huinyabot
A utility and entertainment multi-chat Twitch bot. The bot is built in Java, Gradle and uses Twitch4j as the Twitch API.
This project is for me to learn more about Java and all its tricks.

## Building
You will need at least [JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11) to compile this project. Copy the repository, open it through the terminal, and do what you need to do:
+ *Running*: `./gradlew run`
+ *Building*: `./gradlew shadowJar`
